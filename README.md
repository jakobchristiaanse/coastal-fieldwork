# coastal-fieldwork

Welcome to coastal-fieldwork. This repository contains python code to read and process data from several instruments used in coastal field experiments. At the moment, the following instruments are supported:
- RBR Solo pressure loggers (.rsk files)
- HOBO U20L water loggers (.csv files)
- SOFAR Spotter wave buoys (.csv files)

## Usage
The code allows users to read and process raw data files from the above instruments through classes and methods contained in the file cls_fieldwork.py. Further instructions on the use of the classes and methods is provided through comments in the code.

## Questions
If you have a question about the installation process or notebooks, feel free to open an
